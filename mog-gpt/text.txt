influence in the region, but its whole way of life could be put in
jeopardy—certainly for Athens its democracy and its wealth. Now,
however, war seemed inevitable and a sense of impending doom
quickly settled on the city.
A few days later, the Athenian Assembly met on the Pnyx Hill
overlooking the Acropolis to debate the Spartan ultimatum and decide
what to do. The Assembly was open to all male citizens, and on that
day close to ten thousand of them crowded on the hill to participate in
the debate. The hawks among them were in a state of great agitation—
Athens should seize the initiative and attack Sparta first, they said.
Others reminded them that in a land battle the Spartan forces were
nearly unbeatable. Attacking Sparta in this way would play straight
into their hands. The doves were all in favor of accepting the peace
terms, but as many pointed out, that would only show fear and
embolden the Spartans. It would only give them more time to enlarge
their army. Back and forth went the debate, with emotions getting
heated, people shouting, and no satisfactory solution in sight.
Then toward the end of the afternoon, the crowd suddenly grew
quiet as a familiar figure stepped forward to address the Assembly.
This was Pericles, the elder statesman of Athenian politics, now over
sixty years old. Pericles was beloved, and his opinion would matter
more than anyone’s, but despite the Athenians’ respect for him, they
found him a very peculiar leader—more of a philosopher than a
politician. To those old enough to remember the start of his career, it
was truly surprising how powerful and successful he had become. He
did nothing the usual way.
In the earliest years of their democracy, before Pericles had
appeared on the scene, the Athenians had preferred a certain
personality type in their leaders—men who could give an inspiring,
persuasive speech and had a flair for drama. On the battlefield these
men were risk takers; they often pushed for military campaigns that
they could lead, giving them a chance to gain glory and attention. They
advanced their careers by representing some faction in the Assembly—
landowners, soldiers, aristocrats—and doing everything they could to
further its interests. This led to highly divisive politics. Leaders would
rise and fall in cycles of a few years, but the Athenians were fine with
this; they mistrusted anyone who lasted long in power.
Then Pericles entered public life around 463 BC, and Athenian
politics would never be the same. His first move was the most unusual
of all. Although he came from an illustrious aristocratic family, he
allied himself with the growing lower and middle classes of the city—
farmers, oarsmen in the navy, the craftsmen who were the pride of
Athens. He worked to increase their voice in the Assembly and give
them greater power in the democracy. This was not some small faction
he now led but the majority of Athenian citizens. It would seem
impossible to control such a large, unruly mob of men, with their
varied interests, but he was so fervent in increasing their power that he
slowly gained their trust and backing.
As his influence grew, he started to assert himself in the Assembly
and alter its policies. He argued against expanding Athens’s
democratic empire. He feared the Athenians would overreach and lose
control. He worked to consolidate the empire and strengthen existing
alliances. When it came to war and to serving as a general, he strove to
limit campaigns and to win through maneuvers, with minimal loss of
lives. To many this seemed unheroic, but as these policies took effect,
the city entered a period of unprecedented prosperity. There were no
more needless wars to drain the coffers, and the empire was
functioning more smoothly than ever.
What Pericles did with the growing surplus of money startled and
amazed the citizenry: instead of using it to buy political favors, he
initiated a massive public building project in Athens. He
commissioned temples, theaters, and concert halls, putting all of the
Athenian craftsmen to work. Everywhere one looked, the city was
becoming more sublimely beautiful. He favored a form of architecture
that reflected his personal aesthetics—ordered, highly geometric,
monumental yet soothing to the eye. His greatest commission was that
of the Parthenon, with its enormous forty-foot statue of Athena.
Athena was the guiding spirit of Athens, the goddess of wisdom and
practical intelligence. She represented all of the values Pericles wanted
to promote. Singlehandedly Pericles had transformed the look and
spirit of Athens, and it entered a golden age in all of the arts and
sciences.
What was perhaps the strangest quality of Pericles was his speaking
style—restrained and dignified. He did not go in for the usual flights of
rhetoric. Instead, he worked to convince an audience through airtight
arguments. This would make people listen closely, as they followed the
interesting course of his logic. The style was compelling and calming.
Unlike any of the other leaders, Pericles remained in power year
after year, decade after decade, putting his total stamp on the city in
his quiet, unobtrusive way. He had his enemies. This was inevitable.
He had stayed in power so long that many accused him of being a
secret dictator. He was suspected of being an atheist, a man who
scoffed at all traditions. That would explain why he was so peculiar.
But nobody could argue against the results of his leadership.
And so now, as he began to address the Assembly that afternoon,
his opinion on war with Sparta would carry the most weight, and a
hush came over the crowd as they anxiously waited to hear his
argument.
“Athenians,” he began, “my views are the same as ever: I am against
making any concessions to the Peloponnesians, even though I am
aware that the enthusiastic state of mind in which people are
persuaded to enter upon a war is not retained when it comes to action,
and that people’s minds are altered by the course of events.”
Differences between Athens and Sparta were supposed to be settled
through neutral arbitrators, he reminded them. It would set a
dangerous precedent if they gave in to the Spartans’ unilateral
demands. Where would it end? Yes, a direct land battle with Sparta
would be suicide. What he proposed instead was a completely novel
form of warfare—limited and defensive.
He would bring within the walls of Athens all those living in the
area. Let the Spartans come and try to lure us into fighting, he said; let
them lay waste to our lands. We will not take the bait; we will not fight
them on land. With our access to the sea we will keep the city supplied.
We will use our navy to raid their coastal towns. As time goes on, they
will grow frustrated by the lack of battle. Having to feed and supply
their standing army, they will run out of money. Their allies will bicker
among themselves. The war party within Sparta will be discredited and
a real lasting peace will be agreed upon, all with minimal expenditure
of lives and money on our part.
“I could give you many other reasons,” he concluded, “why you
should feel confident in ultimate victory, if only you will make up your
minds not to add to the empire while the war is in progress, and not to
go out of your way to involve yourselves in new perils. What I fear is
not the enemy’s strategy but our own mistakes.” The novelty of what he
was proposing aroused great debate. Neither hawks nor doves were
satisfied with his plan, but in the end, his reputation for wisdom
carried the day and his strategy was approved. Several months later
the fateful war began.
In the beginning, all did not proceed as Pericles had envisioned. The
Spartans and their allies did not grow frustrated as the war dragged on,
but only bolder. The Athenians were the ones to become discouraged,
seeing their lands destroyed without retaliation. But Pericles believed
his plan could not fail as long as the Athenians remained patient. Then,
in the second year of the war, an unexpected disaster upended
everything: a powerful plague entered the city; with so many people
packed within the walls it spread quickly, killing over one third of the
citizenry and decimating the ranks of the army. Pericles himself caught
the disease, and as he lay dying he witnessed the ultimate nightmare:
all that he had done for Athens over so many decades seemed to
unravel at once, the people descending into group delirium until it was
every man for himself. If he had survived, he almost certainly would
have found a way to calm the Athenians down and broker an
acceptable peace with Sparta, or adjust his defensive strategy, but now
it was too late.
Strangely enough, the Athenians did not mourn for their leader.
They blamed him for the plague and railed at the ineffectiveness of his
strategy. They were not in a mood anymore for patience or restraint.
He had outlived his time, and his ideas were now seen as the tired
reactions of an old man. Their love of Pericles had turned to hate. With
him no longer there, the factions returned with a vengeance. The war
party became popular. The party fed off the people’s growing bitterness
toward the Spartans, who had used the plague to advance their
positions. The hawks promised they would regain the initiative and
crush the Spartans with an offensive strategy. For many Athenians,
such words came as a great relief, a release of pent-up emotions.
As the city slowly recovered from the plague, the Athenians
managed to gain the upper hand, and the Spartans sued for peace.
Wanting to completely defeat their enemy, the Athenians pressed their
advantage, only to find the Spartans recover and turn the tables. Back
and forth it went, year after year. The violence and bitterness on both
sides increased. At one point Athens attacked the island of Melos, a
Spartan ally, and when the Melians surrendered, the Athenians voted
to kill all of their men and sell the women and children into slavery.
Nothing remotely like this had ever happened under Pericles.
Then, after so many years of a war without end, in 415 BC several
Athenian leaders had an interesting idea about how to deliver the fatal
blow. The city-state of Syracuse was the rising power on the island of
Sicily. Syracuse was a critical ally of the Spartans, supplying them with
much-needed resources. If the Athenians, with their great navy, could
launch an expedition and take control of Syracuse, they would gain two
advantages: it would add to their empire, and it would deprive Sparta
of the resources it needed to continue the war. The Assembly voted to
send sixty ships with an appropriate-sized army on board to
accomplish this goal.
One of the commanders assigned to this expedition, Nicias, had
great doubts as to the wisdom of this plan. He feared the Athenians
were underestimating the strength of Syracuse. He laid out all of the
possible negative scenarios; only a much larger expedition could
ensure victory. He wanted to squelch the plan, but his argument had
the opposite effect. If a larger expedition was necessary, then that was
what they would send—one hundred ships and double the number of
soldiers. The Athenians smelled victory in this strategy and nothing
would deter them.
In the ensuing days, Athenians of all ages could be seen in the
streets drawing maps of Sicily, dreaming of the riches that would pour
into Athens and the final humiliation of the Spartans. The day of the
launching of the ships turned into a great holiday and the most awe-
inspiring spectacle they had ever seen—an enormous armada filling the
harbor as far as the eye could see, the ships beautifully decorated, the
soldiers, glistening in their armor, crowding the decks. It was a
dazzling display of the wealth and power of Athens.
As the months went by, the Athenians desperately sought news of
the expedition. At one point, through the sheer size of the force, it
seemed that Athens had gained the advantage and had laid siege to
Syracuse. But at the last moment, reinforcements arrived from Sparta,
and now the Athenians were on the defensive. Nicias sent off a letter to
the Assembly describing this negative turn of events. He recommended
either giving up and returning to Athens, or the sending of
reinforcements right away. Unwilling to believe in the possibility of
defeat, the Athenians voted to send reinforcements—a second armada
of ships almost as large as the first. In the months after this, the
Athenians’ anxiety reached new heights—for now the stakes had been
doubled and Athens could not afford to lose.
One day a barber in Athens’s port town of Piraeus heard a rumor
from a customer that the Athenian expedition, every ship and almost
every man, had been wiped out in battle. The rumor quickly spread to
Athens. It was hard to believe, but slowly panic set in. A week later the
rumor was confirmed and Athens seemed doomed, drained of money,
ships, and men.
Miraculously, the Athenians managed to hold on. But over the next
few years, severely imbalanced by the losses in Sicily, they staggered
from one reeling blow to another, until finally in 405 BC Athens
suffered its final loss and was forced to agree to the harsh terms of
peace imposed by Sparta. Their years of glory, their great democratic
empire, the Periclean golden age were now and forever over. The man
who had curbed their most dangerous emotions—aggression, greed,
hubris, selfishness—had been gone from the scene for too long, his
wisdom long forgotten.
• • •
Interpretation: As Pericles surveyed the political scene early in his
career, he noticed the following phenomenon: Every Athenian political
figure believed he was rational, had realistic goals, and plans on how to
get there. They all worked hard for their political factions and tried to
increase their power. They led Athenian armies into battle and often
came out ahead. They strove to expand the empire and bring in more
money. And when their political maneuvering suddenly backfired, or
the wars turned out badly, they had excellent reasons for why this had
happened. They could always blame the opposition or, if need be, the
gods. And yet, if all these men were so rational, why did their policies
add up to so much chaos and self-destructiveness? Why was Athens
such a mess and the democracy itself so fragile? Why was there so
much corruption and turbulence? The answer was simple: his fellow
Athenians were not rational at all, merely selfish and shrewd. What
guided their decisions was their base emotions—hunger for power,
attention, and money. And for those purposes they could be very
tactical and clever, but none of their maneuvers led to anything that
lasted or served the overall interests of the democracy.
What consumed Pericles as a thinker and a public figure was how to
get out of this trap, how to be truly rational in an arena dominated by
emotions. The solution he came up with is unique in history and
devastatingly powerful in its results. It should serve as our ideal. In his
conception, the human mind has to worship something, has to have its
attention directed to something it values above all else. For most
people, it is their ego; for some it is their family, their clan, their god,
or their nation. For Pericles it would be nous, the ancient Greek word
for “mind” or “intelligence.” Nous is a force that permeates the
universe, creating meaning and order. The human mind is naturally
attracted to this order; this is the source of our intelligence. For
Pericles, the nous that he worshipped was embodied in the figure of
the goddess Athena.
Athena was literally born from the head of Zeus, her name itself
reflecting this—a combination of “god” (theos) and “mind” (nous). But
Athena came to represent a very particular form of nous—eminently
practical, feminine, and earthy. She is the voice that comes to heroes in
times of need, instilling in them a calm spirit, orienting their minds
toward the perfect idea for victory and success, then giving them the
energy to achieve this. To be visited by Athena was the highest blessing
of them all, and it was her spirit that guided great generals and the best
artists, inventors, and tradesmen. Under her influence, a man or
woman could see the world with perfect clarity and hit upon the action
that was just right for the moment. For Athens, her spirit was invoked
to unify the city, make it prosperous and productive. In essence,
Athena stood for rationality, the greatest gift of the gods to mortals, for
it alone could make a human act with divine wisdom.
To cultivate his inner Athena, Pericles first had to find a way to
master his emotions. Emotions turn us inward, away from nous, away
from reality. We dwell on our anger or our insecurities. If we look out
at the world and try to solve problems, we see things through the lens
of these emotions; they cloud our vision. Pericles trained himself to
never react in the moment, to never make a decision while under the
influence of a strong emotion. Instead, he analyzed his feelings.
Usually when he looked closely at his insecurities or his anger, he saw
that they were not really justified, and they lost their significance
under scrutiny. Sometimes he had to physically get away from the
heated Assembly and retire to his house, where he remained alone for
days on end, calming himself down. Slowly, the voice of Athena would
come to him.
He decided to base all of his political decisions on one thing—what
actually served the greater good of Athens. His goal was to unify the
citizenry through genuine love of democracy and belief in the
superiority of the Athenian way. Having such a standard helped him
avoid the ego trap. It impelled him to work to increase the
participation and power of the lower and middle classes, even though
such a strategy could easily turn against him. It inspired him to limit
wars, even though this meant less personal glory for him. And finally it
led to his greatest decision of all—the public works project that
transformed Athens.
To help himself in this deliberative process, he opened his mind to
as many ideas and options as possible, even to those of his opponents.
He imagined all of the possible consequences of a strategy before
committing to it. With a calm spirit and an open mind, he hit upon
policies that sparked one of the true golden ages in history. One man
was able to infect an entire city with his rational spirit. What happened
to Athens after he departed from the scene speaks for itself. The
Sicilian expedition represented everything he had always opposed—a
decision secretly motivated by the desire to grab more land, blinded to
its potential consequences.
Understand: Like everyone, you think you are rational, but you
are not. Rationality is not a power you are born with but one you
acquire through training and practice. The voice of Athena simply
stands for a higher power that exists within you right now, a potential
you have perhaps felt in moments of calmness and focus, the perfect
idea coming to you after much thinking. You are not connected to this
higher power in the present because your mind is weighed down with
emotions. Like Pericles in the Assembly, you are infected by all of the
drama that others churn up; you are continually reacting to what
people give you, experiencing waves of excitement, insecurity, and
anxiety that make it hard to focus. Your attention is pulled this way
and that, and without the rational standard to guide your decisions,
you never quite reach the goals that you set. At any moment this can
change with a simple decision—to cultivate your inner Athena.
Rationality is then what you will value the most and that which will
serve as your guide.
Your first task is to look at those emotions that are continually
infecting your ideas and decisions. Learn to question yourself: Why
this anger or resentment? Where does this incessant need for attention
come from? Under such scrutiny, your emotions will lose their hold on
you. You will begin to think for yourself instead of reacting to what
others give you. Emotions tend to narrow the mind, making us focus
on one or two ideas that satisfy our immediate desire for power or
attention, ideas that usually backfire. Now, with a calm spirit, you can
entertain a wide range of options and solutions. You will deliberate
longer before acting and reassess your strategies. The voice will
become clearer and clearer. When people besiege you with their
endless dramas and petty emotions, you will resent the distraction and
apply your rationality to think past them. Like an athlete continually
getting stronger through training, your mind will become more flexible
and resilient. Clear and calm, you will see answers and creative
solutions that no one else can envision.
It’s just as though one’s second self were standing beside one; one is
sensible and rational oneself, but the other self is impelled to do something
perfectly senseless, and sometimes very funny; and suddenly you notice
that you are longing to do that amusing thing, goodness knows why; that is,
you want to, as it were, against your will; though you fight agains
Unexpected losses or a string of losses equally create irrational
reactions. We imagine we are cursed with bad luck and that this will go
on indefinitely. We become fearful and hesitant, which will often lead
to more mistakes or failures. In sports, this can induce what is known
as choking, as previous losses and misses weigh on the mind and
tighten it up.
The solution here is simple: whenever you experience unusual gains
or losses, that is precisely the time to step back and counterbalance
them with some necessary pessimism or optimism. Be extra wary of
sudden success and attention—they are not built on anything that lasts
and they have an addictive pull. And the fall is always painful.
Rising Pressure
The people around you generally appear sane and in control of their
lives. But put any of them in stressful circumstances, with the pressure
rising, and you will see a different reality. The cool mask of self-control
comes off. They suddenly lash out in anger, reveal a paranoid streak,
and become hypersensitive and often petty. Under stress or any threat,
the most primitive parts of the brain are aroused and engaged,
overwhelming people’s reasoning powers. In fact, stress or tension can
reveal flaws in people that they have carefully concealed from view. It
is often wise to observe people in such moments, precisely as a way to
judge their true character.
Whenever you notice rising pressure and stress levels in your life,
you must watch yourself carefully. Monitor any signs of unusual
brittleness or sensitivity, sudden suspicions, fears disproportionate to
the circumstances. Observe with as much detachment as possible,
finding time and space to be alone. You need perspective. Never
imagine that you are someone who can withstand rising stress without
emotional leakage. It is not possible. But through self-awareness and
reflection you can prevent yourself from making decisions you will
come to regret.
Inflaming Individuals
There are people in the world who by their nature tend to trigger
powerful emotions in almost everyone they encounter. These emotions
range among the extremes of love, hatred, confidence, and mistrust.
Some examples in history would include King David in the Bible,
Alcibiades in ancient Athens, Julius Caesar in ancient Rome, Georges
Danton during the French Revolution, and Bill Clinton. These types
have a degree of charisma—they have the ability to express eloquently
emotions they are feeling, which inevitably stirs parallel emotions in
others. But some of them can also be quite narcissistic; they project
their internal drama and troubles outward, catching other people up in
the turmoil they create. This leads to profound feelings of attraction in
some and repulsion in others.
It is best to recognize these inflamers by how they affect others, not
just yourself. No one can remain indifferent to them. People find
themselves incapable of reasoning or maintaining any distance in their
presence. They make you think of them continually when not in their
presence. They have an obsessive quality, and they can lead you to
extreme actions as a devoted follower or as an inveterate enemy. On
either end of the spectrum—attraction or repulsion—you will tend to
be irrational and you will desperately need to distance yourself. A good
strategy to utilize is to see through the front they project. They
inevitably try to cast a larger-than-life image, a mythic, intimidating
quality; but in fact they are all too human, full of the same insecurities
and weaknesses we all possess. Try to recognize these very human
traits and demythologize them.
The Group Effect
This is the high-grade variety of the group bias. When we are in a
group of a large enough size, we become different. Notice yourself and
others at a sporting event, a concert, a religious or political gathering.
It is impossible to not feel yourself caught up in the collective
emotions. Your heart beats faster. Tears of joy or sadness come more
readily. Being in a group does not stimulate independent reasoning but
rather the intense desire to belong. This can happen equally in a work
environment, particularly if the leader plays on people’s emotions to
spur competitive, aggressive desires, or creates an us-versus-them
dynamic. The group effect does not necessarily require the presence of
others. It can occur virally, as some opinion spreads over social media
and infects us with the desire to share the opinion—generally of a
strong variety, such as outrage.
There is an exhilarating, positive aspect to the stimulation of group
emotions. It is how we can be rallied to do something for the collective
good. But if you notice the appeal is to more diabolical emotions, such
as hatred of the other, rabid patriotism, aggression, or sweeping
worldviews, you need to inoculate yourself and see through the
powerful pull as it works on you. It is often best to avoid the group
setting if possible in order to maintain your reasoning powers, or to
enter such moments with maximum skepticism.
Be aware of demagogues who exploit the group effect and stimulate
outbreaks of irrationality. They inevitably resort to certain devices. In a
group setting, they begin by warming up the crowd, talking about ideas
and values that everyone shares, creating a pleasant feeling of
agreement. They rely on vague but loaded words full of emotive quality
such as justice or truth or patriotism. They talk of abstract, noble goals
rather than the solving of specific problems with concrete action.
Demagogues in politics or the media try to stir a continual sense of
panic, urgency, and outrage. They must keep the emotional levels high.
Your defense is simple: Consider your reasoning powers, your ability to
think for yourself, your most precious possession. Resent any kind of
intrusion upon your independent mind by others. When you feel you
are in the presence of a demagogue, become doubly wary and
analytical.
—
A final word on the irrational in human nature: do not imagine that the
more extreme types of irrationality have somehow been overcome
through progress and enlightenment. Throughout history we witness
continual cycles of rising and falling levels of the irrational. The great
golden age of Pericles, with its philosophers and its first stirrings of the
scientific spirit, was followed by an age of superstition, cults, and
intolerance. This same phenomenon happened after the Italian
Renaissance. That this cycle is bound to recur again and again is part
of human nature.
The irrational simply changes its look and its fashions. We may no
longer have literal witch hunts, but in the twentieth century, not so
very long ago, we witnessed the show trials of Stalin, the McCarthy
hearings in the U.S. Senate, and the mass persecutions during the
Chinese Cultural Revolution. Various cults are continually being
generated, including cults of personality and the fetishizing of
celebrities. Technology now inspires religious fervor. People have a
desperate need to believe in something and they will find it anywhere.
Polls have revealed that increasing numbers of people believe in
ghosts, spirits, and angels, in the twenty-first century.
As long as there are humans, the irrational will find its voices and
means of spreading. Rationality is something to be acquired by
individuals, not by mass movements or technological progress. Feeling
superior and beyond it is a sure sign that the irrational is at work.
Step Three: Strategies Toward Bringing Out the Rational
Self
Despite our pronounced irrational tendencies, two factors should give
us all hope. First and foremost is the existence throughout history and
in all cultures of people of high rationality, the types who have made
progress possible. They serve as ideals for all of us to aim for. These
include Pericles, the ruler Aśoka of ancient India, Marcus Aurelius of
ancient Rome, Marguerite de Valois in medieval France, Leonardo da
Vinci, Charles Darwin, Abraham Lincoln, the writer Anton Chekhov,
the anthropologist Margaret Mead, and the businessman Warren
Buffett, to name but a few. All of these types share certain qualities—a
realistic appraisal of themselves and their weaknesses; a devotion to
truth and reality; a tolerant attitude toward people; and the ability to
reach goals that they have set.
The second factor is that almost all of us at some point in our lives
have experienced moments of greater rationality. This often comes
with what we shall call the maker’s mind-set. We have a project to get
done, perhaps with a deadline. The only emotion we can afford is
excitement and energy. Other emotions simply make it impossible to
concentrate. Because we have to get results, we become exceptionally
practical. We focus on the work—our mind calm, our ego not
intruding. If people try to interrupt or infect us with emotions, we
resent it. These moments—as fleeting as a few weeks or hours—reveal
the rational self that is waiting to come out. It just requires some
awareness and some practice.
The following strategies are designed to help you bring out that
inner Pericles or Athena:
Know yourself thoroughly. The Emotional Self thrives on
ignorance. The moment you are aware of how it operates and
dominates you is the moment it loses its hold on you and can be
tamed. Therefore, your first step toward the rational is always inward.
You want to catch that Emotional Self in action. For this purpose, you
must reflect on how you operate under stress. What particular
weaknesses come out in such moments—the desire to please, to bully
or control, deep levels of mistrust? Look at your decisions, especially
those that have been ineffective—can you see a pattern, an underlying
insecurity that impels them? Examine your strengths, what makes you
different from other people. This will help you decide upon goals that
mesh with your long-term interests and that are aligned with your
skills. By knowing and valuing what marks you as different, you will
also be able to resist the pull of the group bias and effect.
Examine your emotions to their roots. You are angry. Let the
feeling settle from within, and think about it. Was it triggered by
something seemingly trivial or petty? That is a sure sign that
something or someone else is behind it. Perhaps a more uncomfortable
emotion is at the source—such as envy or paranoia. You need to look at
this square in the eye. Dig below any trigger points to see where they
started. For these purposes, it might be wise to use a journal in which
you record your self-assessments with ruthless objectivity. Your
greatest danger here is your ego and how it makes you unconsciously
maintain illusions about yourself. These may be comforting in the
moment, but in the long run they make you defensive and unable to
learn or progress. Find a neutral position from which you can observe
your actions, with a bit of detachment and even humor. Soon all of this
will become second nature, and when the Emotional Self suddenly
rears its head in some situation, you will see it as it happens and be
able to step back and find that neutral position.
Increase your reaction time. This power comes through
practice and repetition. When some event or interaction requires a
response, you must train yourself to step back. This could mean
physically removing yourself to a place where you can be alone and not
feel any pressure to respond. Or it could mean writing that angry email
but not sending it. You sleep on it for a day or two. You do not make
phone calls or communicate while feeling some sudden emotion,
particularly resentment. If you find yourself rushing to commit to
people, to hire or be hired by them, step back and give it a day. Cool
the emotions down. The longer you can take the better, because
perspective comes with time. Consider this like resistance training—
the longer you can resist reacting, the more mental space you have for
actual reflection, and the stronger your mind will become.
Accept people as facts. Interactions with people are the major
source of emotional turmoil, but it doesn’t have to be that way. The
problem is that we are continually judging people, wishing they were
something that they are not. We want to change them. We want them
to think and act a certain way, most often the way we think and act.
And because this is not possible, because everyone is different, we are
continually frustrated and upset. Instead, see other people as
phenomena, as neutral as comets or plants. They simply exist. They
come in all varieties, making life rich and interesting. Work with what
they give you, instead of resisting and trying to change them. Make
understanding people a fun game, the solving of puzzles. It is all part of
the human comedy. Yes, people are irrational, but so are you. Make
your acceptance of human nature as radical as possible. This will calm
you down and help you observe people more dispassionately,
understanding them on a deeper level. You will stop projecting your
own emotions on to them. All of this will give you more balance and
calmness, more mental space for thinking.
It is certainly difficult to do this with the nightmare types who cross
our path—the raging narcissists, the passive aggressors, and other
inflamers. They remain a continual test to our rationality. Look at the
Russian writer Anton Chekhov, one of the most fiercely rational people
who ever lived, as the model for this. His family was large and poor,
and his father, an alcoholic, mercilessly beat all of the children,
including young Chekhov. Chekhov became a doctor and took up
writing as a side career. He applied his training as a doctor to the
human animal, his goal to understand what makes us so irrational, so
unhappy, and so dangerous. In his stories and plays, he found it
immensely therapeutic to get inside his characters and make sense of
even the worst types. In this way, he could forgive anybody, even his
father. His approach in these cases was to imagine that each person, no
matter how twisted, has a reason for what they’ve become, a logic that
makes sense to them. In their own way, they are striving for
fulfillment, but irrationally. By stepping back and imagining their story
from the inside, Chekhov demythologized the brutes and aggressors;
he cut them down to human size. They no longer elicited hatred but
rather pity. You must think more like a writer in approaching the
people you deal with, even the worst sorts.
Find the optimal balance of thinking and emotion. We
cannot divorce emotions from thinking. The two are completely
intertwined. But there is inevitably a dominant factor, some people
more clearly governed by emotions than others. What we are looking
for is the proper ratio and balance, the one that leads to the most
effective action. The ancient Greeks had an appropriate metaphor for
this: the rider and the horse.
The horse is our emotional nature continually impelling us to move.
This horse has tremendous energy and power, but without a rider it
cannot be guided; it is wild, subject to predators, and continually
heading into trouble. The rider is our thinking self. Through training
and practice, it holds the reins and guides the horse, transforming this
powerful animal energy into something productive. The one without
the other is useless. Without the rider, no directed movement or
purpose. Without the horse, no energy, no power. In most people the
horse dominates, and the rider is weak. In some people the rider is too
strong, holds the reins too tightly, and is afraid to occasionally let the
animal go into a gallop. The horse and rider must work together. This
means we consider our actions beforehand; we bring as much thinking
as possible to a situation before we make a decision. But once we
decide what to do, we loosen the reins and enter action with boldness
and a spirit of adventure. Instead of being slaves to this energy, we
channel it. That is the essence of rationality.
As an example of this ideal in action, try to maintain a perfect
balance between skepticism (rider) and curiosity (horse). In this mode
you are skeptical about your own enthusiasms and those of others. You
do not accept at face value people’s explanations and their application
of “evidence.” You look at the results of their actions, not what they say
about their motivations. But if you take this too far, your mind will
close itself off from wild ideas, from exciting speculations, from
curiosity itself. You want to retain the elasticity of spirit you had as a
child, interested in everything, while retaining the hard-nosed need to
verify and scrutinize for yourself all ideas and beliefs. The two can
coexist. It is a balance that all geniuses possess.
Love the rational. It is important to not see the path to
rationality as something painful and ascetic. In fact, it brings powers
that are immensely satisfying and pleasurable, much deeper than the
more manic pleasures the world tends to offer us. You have felt this in
your own life when absorbed in a project, time flowing by, and
experiencing occasional bursts of excitement as you make discoveries
or progress in your work. There are other pleasures as well. Being able
to tame the Emotional Self leads to an overall calmness and clarity. In
this state of mind you are less consumed by petty conflicts and
considerations. Your actions are more effective, which also leads to less
turmoil. You have the immense satisfaction of mastering yourself in a
deep way. You have more mental space to be creative. You feel more in
control.
Knowing all of this, it will become easier to motivate yourself to
develop this power. In this sense, you are following the path of Pericles
himself. He envisioned the goddess Athena embodying all of the
practical powers of rationality. He worshipped and loved this goddess
above all others. We may no longer venerate the goddess as a deity, but
we can appreciate on a deep level all of those who promote rationality
in our own world, and we can seek to internalize their power as much
as we can.
“Trust your feelings!”—But feelings are nothing final or original; behind
feelings there stand judgments and evaluations which we inherit in the
form of . . . inclinations, aversions. . . . The inspiration born of a feeling is
the grandchild of a judgment—and often of a false judgment!—and in any
event not a child of your own! To trust one’s feelings—means to give more
obedience to one’s grandfather and grandmother and their grandparents
than to the gods which are in us: our reason and our experience.
—Friedrich Nietzsche
